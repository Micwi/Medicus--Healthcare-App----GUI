# Description of project

This was our final project for our Software Engineering class. We built a GUI to represent a healthcare app. The app's functions include: virtual medical portal, meal prep, home delivery of food, medicine, etc. 
To assist the service providers as well as the customers to keep record of their services and routine assistance. We implemented users to have certain priviledges based on their user type. There are four types of users: Client, Admin, Provider, Physician. 
Clients are able to create new orders(food or medicine), view their medical and order history
Admins are able to view all operations
Providers get a notification when there is a new order. They can view their past orders (that they completed) in a list format. They can also view the new orders in a list format as well. They also have the ability to contact the customer's physician to make sure the order (medicine) is appropriate.
Physicians have a list of all their clients that they are taking care of and is able to view their medical histories.

Other Details:
•	Worked in a team of four to create a software that allows for clients to place orders, view medical records, and view their order history
•	Connected software with a real-time database (Not active anymore) and was able to interact with it and update data already stored in database
•	Used software engineering methods/models and concepts to approach the problem at hand and came up with a solution 
•	Worked in a fast-paced environment
